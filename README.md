# WebScraper
### A simple yet effective tool to get data from the web

## Description
The project is made entirely using *GO* language & a 3rd party library named *Colly*

This project allows the user to swiftly scrape the needed data from the website of one's choice.
After a bit of initial setup (choosing what exactly we want to look for in the website),
the navigation throughout the project is rather simple due to its low code volume.

The project doesn't include a proxy, so it can't really scrape protected websites.
Nevertheless, it serves as a great tool for some content managers as well as starting developers,
allowing them to get data freely and practice processing the data.

## Pros
+ **Simplicity** due to low code volume
+ Accessible .exe file build to run the script straight from the user's machine
+ Easy adjustment to user's needs

## Cons
+ No proxy involved

## Summary
The project itself is a simple tool made to help other developers with access to the data from the real world
Even though the project is small, there's still room to further develop it and make it even more automated
